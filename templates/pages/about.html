            <h2 class="section-title">About</h2>
            <p>
                Although my curiosity for technology has always been present, my professional journey began in operations, business systems, and cross-functional leadership across industries like e-commerce, executive event management, and the wine trade. 
                In 2024, I deepened my understanding of technology by studying backend development, Python, and systems thinking through Harvard’s CS50 curriculum and hands-on projects. That experience helped me realize where I work best: at the intersection of strategy, 
                execution, and work that requires systems thinking. I now focus on roles that blend project coordination, process improvement, and technical fluency-whether that means aligning stakeholders, building better workflows, or supporting product 
                and ops teams from planning through delivery. I bring a versatile background, a calm-under-pressure mindset, and a strong belief that thoughtful systems, communication, and collaboration are what drive real results.

        <h3 class="section-title">My Background</h2>
        <div>
            <h4 class="h5 fw-bold mt-5">Business & Founding</h4>
            <p>
            My four years at both The Wine Forum and Wine Friends taught me what it means to run a business, wear many hats, and solve problems from multiple angles. I learned how to take ownership, manage stakeholders, and navigate the real-world complexities of scaling small, 
            high-impact operations. At The Wine Forum, I had the privilege of hosting a series of events at The World Economic Forum in Davos-an experience that sharpened my communication and logistics skills while exposing me to global leadership and fast-paced, 
            high-stakes environments. While these ventures operated in the wine and executive events spaces, the core lessons I took away-around leadership, systems thinking, and execution-now inform my work in project management and operations.
            </p>
            <h4 class="h5 fw-bold mt-5">Creative Work</h4>
            <p>
            In 2019, I made the decision to leave UC Santa Barbara after two years of undergrad. I wasn't finding the challenge or direction I needed-so I pivoted into a more hands-on creative path. I dove deep into music production, studying it intensively and working 
            professionally as both a producer and artist. Over the course of several years, I spent 7,000+ hours mastering Ableton Live, producing and releasing music that earned over 250,000 streams across platforms. That chapter of my life taught me the power of iteration, 
            self-discipline, and deep focus-skills that now shape how I approach complex projects, workflows, and cross-functional collaboration. I returned to finish my BA in management from the University of San Francisco a few years later and am now applying many of those 
            skills to my work.
            </p>
            <h4 class="h5 fw-bold mt-5">Software Engineering</h4>
            <p>
            Through my experience in logistics, fulfillment, and event planning, I became increasingly drawn to the systems behind how things work-and how to improve them. That interest led me to explore technical tools like Python, backend systems, and data workflows, which now 
            complement my hands-on experience managing cross-functional projects. I’m especially focused on the intersection of operations, technology, and strategy-where well-run systems and clear communication can drive real impact.
            My strength lies in blending systems thinking with human insight. I naturally zoom out to see the full picture-while staying grounded in the details that make things run. I’m drawn to environments where clarity, structure, and empathy come together to create momentum.
            I thrive in roles that sit at the intersection of people and process, where communication, execution, and thoughtful systems lead to lasting change.
