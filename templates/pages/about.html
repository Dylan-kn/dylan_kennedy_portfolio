            <h2 class="section-title">About</h2>
            <p>
            Though I've always had an interest in technology and innovation, I didn't seriously pursue it as a career until 2024. That January, I began learning HTML and CSS through freeCodeCamp. 
            After a break, I came back to it with more focus and self-awareness, enrolling in Harvard's CS50x and diving into computer science fundamentals.
            From there, I picked up momentum: I began building hands-on projects, explored CS50P (Python), and started honing in on the areas that truly interested me —  
            AI, security engineering, and backend web development. I've since studied cybersecurity through TryHackMe and explored encryption, LLMs, and backend architecture. I'm very energized by how fast this space is evolving and 
            am eager to apply my years in various sectors to this career path.

        <h3 class="section-title">My Background</h2>
        <div>
            <h4 class="h5 fw-bold mt-5">Business & Founding</h4>
            <p>
            My three years as part of both The Wine Forum and Wine Friends exposed me to what it means to run a business, wear many hats, solve problems from many angles, take on responsibility
            and confront the intricacies of building businesses. I had the pleasure of hosting a series of events at The World Economic Forum in Davos, which exposed me further
            to the business and financial worlds, as well as enabled me to connect with executive leadership from around the world. Beyond the fact that these business operated in the wine, and 
            executive events spaces, I learned valuable lessons about founding businesses, managing stakeholders and output, and I believe have set me up well to now transition into software engineering.
            </p>
            <h4 class="h5 fw-bold mt-5">Creative Work</h4>
            <p>
             Back in 2019, I made the decision to leave university after two years of undergrad at UC Santa Barbara. I never found the subject matter that pushed me, and ultimately needed a change of setting.
             This move was followed by intense education in music production, and subsequent professional work as producer and artist. I garnered well over 7000 hours of hands on
             experience in Ableton Live, many of which translate well into software engineering. This chapter of my life taught me resilience, consistency and skill development. I eventually 
             garnered over 250,000 streams across all platforms, and still have a passion for music (though it has become more of a hobby now). I believe these skills and the resilience it took to become
             good at something, are invaluable. 
            </p>
            <h4 class="h5 fw-bold mt-5">Software Engineering</h4>
            <p>
             I am now fully focused on becoming a great software engineer. I've developed a passion for AI, backend development and cybersecurity. I'm drawn to building clean, functional
             systems and applying my skills to solve real-world problems. I have a solid foundation in Python, Django, and web development, and I'm eager to learn more about security engineering and AI integration.
