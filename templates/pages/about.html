            <h2 class="section-title">About</h2>
            <p>
            Though I've always had an interest in technology and innovation, I didn't seriously pursue it as a career until 2024. That January, I began learning HTML and CSS through freeCodeCamp. 
            After a break, I came back to it with more focus and self-awareness, enrolling in Harvard's CS50x and diving into computer science fundamentals.
            From there, I picked up momentum: I began building hands-on projects, explored CS50P (Python), and started honing in on the areas that truly interested me --  
            AI, security engineering, and backend web development. I've since studied cybersecurity through TryHackMe and explored encryption, LLMs, and backend architecture. I'm very energized by how fast this space is evolving and 
            am eager to apply my years in various sectors to this career path.

        <h3 class="section-title">My Background</h2>
        <div>
            <h4 class="h5 fw-bold mt-5">Business & Founding</h4>
            <p>
            My three years at both The Wine Forum and Wine Friends taught me what it means to run a business, wear many hats, and solve problems from multiple angles. I learned to take on responsibility, 
            manage stakeholders and navigate the intricacies of building businesses. I had the privilege of hosting a series of events at The World Economic Forum in Davos, which further exposed me
            to global business and financial leadership, and sharpened my communication and operational skills. While these businesses operated in the wine and 
            executive events spaces, I learned valuable lessons about leadership, execution and systems that directly inform my approach to software engineering today.
            </p>
            <h4 class="h5 fw-bold mt-5">Creative Work</h4>
            <p>
            In 2019, I made the decision to leave UC Santa Barbara after two years of undergrad. I wasn't finding the challenge or direction I needed 
            -- so I pivoted into a more hands-on creative path. I dove deep into music production, studying it intensively and working professionally as both a producer and artist. 
            I spent over 7,000 hours mastering Ableton Live, producing and releasing music that earned over 250,000 streams across platforms. This chapter of my life taught me resilience, consistency and how to build skill through
            focus and interation -- habits that now serve me well in software engineering.
            </p>
            <h4 class="h5 fw-bold mt-5">Software Engineering</h4>
            <p>
             I am now fully focused on becoming a great software engineer. I've developed a passion for AI, backend development and cybersecurity. I'm drawn to building clean, functional
             systems and applying my skills to solving real-world problems. I have a solid foundation in Python, Django, and web development, and I'm eager to learn more about security engineering and AI integration.
