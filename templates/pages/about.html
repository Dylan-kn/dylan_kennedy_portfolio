            <h2 class="section-title">About</h2>
            <p>
                Although my curiosity for technology has always been present, my professional journey began in operations, business systems, and cross-functional leadership across industries like e-commerce, executive event management, and the wine trade. 
                In 2024, I took a deeper dive into the tech world - learning HTML, CSS, and then progressing through Harvardâ€™s CS50x and CS50P to build a strong foundation in computer science, backend development, SQL and Python programming.
                As I built web apps and explored LLMs, encryption, and cybersecurity through platforms like TryHackMe, I realized my strength lies at the intersection of business strategy, systems thinking, and technical execution. I now focus on roles 
                where I can use that blend, improving processes, aligning teams, and building tools that enable better decisions and scalable growth.
                My goal is to contribute to mission-driven tech companies in strategy, operations, or product-aligned roles, while continuing to evolve technically. I bring a versatile background, a resilient mindset, and a deep appreciation for how technology and 
                thoughtful systems can empower both teams and users.

        <h3 class="section-title">My Background</h2>
        <div>
            <h4 class="h5 fw-bold mt-5">Business & Founding</h4>
            <p>
            My three years at both The Wine Forum and Wine Friends taught me what it means to run a business, wear many hats, and solve problems from multiple angles. I learned to take on responsibility, 
            manage stakeholders and navigate the intricacies of building businesses. I had the privilege of hosting a series of events at The World Economic Forum in Davos, which further exposed me
            to global business and financial leadership, and sharpened my communication and operational skills. While these businesses operated in the wine and 
            executive events spaces, I learned valuable lessons about leadership, execution and systems that directly inform my approach to software engineering today.
            </p>
            <h4 class="h5 fw-bold mt-5">Creative Work</h4>
            <p>
            In 2019, I made the decision to leave UC Santa Barbara after two years of undergrad. I wasn't finding the challenge or direction I needed 
            -- so I pivoted into a more hands-on creative path. I dove deep into music production, studying it intensively and working professionally as both a producer and artist. 
            I spent over 7,000 hours mastering Ableton Live, producing and releasing music that earned over 250,000 streams across platforms. This chapter of my life taught me resilience, consistency and how to build skill through
            focus and interation -- habits that now serve me well in software engineering.
            </p>
            <h4 class="h5 fw-bold mt-5">Software Engineering</h4>
            <p>
             By diving into the world of coding and software, I have developed an interest in AI, backend development and cybersecurity. I'm drawn to the intersection of technology and humanity, bridging the gap between technical and analytical.
            I have a solid foundation in Python, Django, and web development, and I'm eager to apply my diverse background to learning more.
